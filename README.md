A manuscript investigating the relative importance of baroclinic and barotropic processes for eddy saturation in Southern Ocean-like zonally re-entrant channel on a beta-plane.

Simulations were performed using GFDL's [Modular Ocean Model version 6][mom6]. Input and configuration files for the simulations can be found in repository [EddySaturation-MOM6][mom6-input].
